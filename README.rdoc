== ScriptRunner

ScriptRunner is a simple GUI tool for running bash scripts. If you have bunch of bash scripts that 
you need to run on a day-to-day basis, this application would serve you best. 
 - You can add/edit/delete scripts
 - Just a click executes the script
 - After execution, it shows the stdout & stderr
 - You can always come back & view stdout & stderr until you run again in which case it will overwrite
 the previous stdout/stderr
